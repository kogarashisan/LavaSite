#The src/ directory
System-wide or uncategorized
	- [P5,Refactoring] isLiteral - move to one place
	- [P5,Refactoring] "use strict"
	- [P3,Feature,Q] new selector for event and role targets: NameAndLabel
		// affects ExpressionParser, view.Abstract, ViewManager
	- [P3,Feature] New selector for event and role targets: "Instance" - for adding targets at run time
		// also use it in DropDown
	- [P3,Refactoring,Performance] inside sleep() of the views it's not needed to turn off the argument listeners, only arguments themselves.
	- [P5,Performance,Q] turn off view bindings in sleep() (*)
	- [P5,Feature,Q] hard_refresh event for views hierarchy
		// to force refresh of views, which are bound to plain JS objects (like Angular refresh cycle)
	- [P5,Feature,Performance,Q] new kind of template includes - inlineInclude. Will be replaced in config, once and forever.
	- [P2,Refactoring] Widget and Refresher* must not access Firestorm.Element
	- [P3,Refactoring] CONTROL_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX and some other constants must be moved into Lava or schema
	- [P5,Refactoring] remove "active modifiers" (see parsers, Argument and support)
	- [P3,Feature] CSS compression, including class names
	- [P3,Feature] Resource names compression
	- [P5,Refactoring] search the framework code and find possibilities to rewrite for usage of:
		Firestorm.Array.exclude and Firestorm.Object.copy
		// Firestorm.Object.copy may be used in ClassManager in place of extend()
	- [P3,Feature] config extenders should be turned into normal class, and created in Lava.init()
	- [P3,Feature,Performance] new kind of argument - StaticArgument for one-time calculations. Use it in static_eval
		// must not attach listeners
	- [P3,Refactoring,Performance] Possible optimization: if Argument is equal to scope binding, than do not create an argument, get the binding.
		// search every place where Argument is used
	- [P3,Feature,Performance] Segment option to evaluate it's property name only once and do not create listeners
		// in expression parser it will be curly braces instead of square: row{column.name}
	- [P4,Refactoring] Move some exception texts into Lava.known_exceptions (like 'abstract function call')
	- [P5,Feature,Q] add possibility to have several Lava versions on one page
	- [P4,Refactoring] one DEBUG switch should be split into several.
		// like:
		// DEBUG_SCOPES - the scope processiong cycle,<br/>
		// DEBUG_FATAL - useful explanations before something will fail anyway (may be safely turned off in release),<br/>
		// DEBUG_DEV - wrong configuration by the programmer. <br/>
		// DEBUG_PARSERS - wrong templates <br/>
		// DEBUG_LISTENERS - listeners on destroyed objects
	- [P5,Refactoring] some DEBUG checks should become permanent (remove "DEBUG" condition)
	- [P3,Refactoring] _cRawBlock.class_locator.name - rename to locator and change type to _cViewLocator.
		Same for _cWidgetConfig.class_locator.
	- [P3,Refactoring] ScopeManager::scheduleScopeRefresh: do not return an object, use property of the Refreshable.
	- [P2,Dev] recursive x:binding and x:assign protection.
		// Currently, you can create an assign of any property to itself
	- [P2,Refactoring] remove the 'extender: "Standard"' from widget configs. Currently, it's the only available extender
		// if config does not have an "extender" specified, than it should default to "Standard". Affects: Lava.js and config generation.
	- [P5,Refactoring] each destroy() must call parent's destroy() in the end (not earlier)
	- [P5,Feature,Q] (experimental) create a lighter fork of the framework: without Refreshable mixin.
	- [P2,Performance] Optimize config extension: widget configs without parent must be created with `is_extended = true`
		// 1) widgets with static class name must have full class name in the "class" attribute.
		// 2) with dynamic class name - must have locator gateway in 'class'.
	- [P5,Refactoring] FocusManager: specification recommends to use focus() instead of blur()
		// https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#focus-management-apis
	- [P5,Performance] one-time expression evaluations, like x:static_eval or one-time assign,
		must be evaluated without creating bindings, using evalPathConfig()
	- [P5,Performance] labels for inputs (with "for" attribute) need to be rendered as text
		// Now they must to be views, otherwise "for" attribute can not be set. If there is no other functionality
		// except "for" attribute, then label should be rendered as static text.
	- [P2,Refactoring] wrap the code that adds Refreshable listeners into a method in Refreshable
		// three lines of code, that add "waits_refresh" "refreshed" and "changed" listeners in classes in Scope layer
	- [P4,Refactoring] Rewrite TemplateWalker without "throw"
	- [P1,Refactoring] rename certain UPPER_CASE properties in Firestorm and schemas.
		Refactor Firestorm.Environment - store test results in an array (indices will be stored as separate {NAME => index} object)
		// if property value is determined at run time (not on server) - it must be lower case

Lava.js
	- [P2,Refactoring] simplify getWidgetSugarInstance(), get rid of _widget_title_to_sugar_instance
	- [P2,Refactoring] bootstrap() process produces an empty `class` attribute on &lt;body&gt; element.
		Fix that, if possible.
Animation/
	- [P5,Feature] pulsating and cyclic animations
		// most likely, there will be another independent class - AnimationSequence
	- [P5,Feature,Q] animations should switch to transitions, if browser supports them
		// there must be a separate setting in the shema, USE_TRANSITIONS
	- [P5,Feature] native Scroll animation, which adjusts it's duration in dependency to acroll distance
		// Dependency should be logarithmic. Use it in documentation page, instead of Fx.Scroll
	- [P3,Feature] add reverse_direction option to config (when animation is created - it's already reversed)
Animation/BootstrapCollapse.class.js
	- [P5,Feature] check for transitions support. If browser does not support transitions - apply end state immediately, without waiting.
Animation/Toggle.class.js
	- [P5,Refactoring] must inherit from Emulated, + missing some important code
Animation/Emulated.class.js
	- [P5,Fix] does not refresh it's started_time and some other variables
		// they are not used by the class, but may be needed for synchronization
Data/
	- [P4,Feature] Allow to name 'id' column differently
	- [P4,Feature] Allow string IDs (currently, only numbers are supported)
	- [P2,Feature] schema switch to turn off validation
	- [P2,Feature] an ability to unload records from modules to free memory.
	- [P3,Feature] DateTime field. Will be serialized to integer, but internal value will be a Date object.
	- [P4,Feature] Record and Collection fields should be exportable
	- [P5,Feature] fields with calculated value and dependencies.
		// Something like this:
		// <pre>title: {
		//		get: function() { return this.get('first_name') + ' ' + ...}
		//		depends:['first_name', 'last_name']
		//	}</pre>
	- [P5,Feature] MetaStorage: allow Collection and Record fields inside it
Data/Field/
	- [P5,Performance,Q] Integer and Id fields: invent some better check than regex
		// this._shared.valid_value_regex.test(value)
Data/ModuleAbstract.class.js
	- [P5,Refactoring] destroy: should the records be destroyed, and how? See comment inside destroy()
	- [P3,Performance,Refactoring] record storage should be created from a function (now it's an object)
Data/Module.class.js
	- [P2,Refactoring] Move _records_by_id functionality to the ID field
Firestorm/
	- [P5,Feature] Element.fromHTML(html)
		// turn html into nodes, assert there is only one and return it
	- [P5,Performance] use insertAdjacentHTML where possible (*)
	- [P5,Performance] implement fast offset calculation algorithm (*)
	- [P4,Performance] use native element's classList property in addClass(es), removeClass(es), hasClass
	- [P5,Feature] hashchange event emulation for old/mobile browsers (not supported in Opera mini)
	- [P3,Feature] native setters like setClass and setHTML
	- [P2,Feature] Array.select(), selectFirst() - like filter, but returns another array
	- [P2,Refactoring,Q] Firestorm.Environment - rename to Browser
	- [P5,Feature] finish Firestorm
	- [P5,Feature] When getting rid of MooTools: provide a file with shims for methods that do not exist in older
		JavaScript environments. For example: Array.forEach (the to_do_app depends on it) or Object.keys
Parsers/
	- [P2,Dev] make the text for exception "Text is not allowed in this context" inside asBlocks() more meaningful
		// text should depend on context
	- [P3,Feature] x:controller control attribute - similar to x:widget
		// create an inline widget from element, with specified controller class. Also should work on sugar.
	- [P5,Feature,Q] static_value directive should treat it's content as default value.
	- [P3,Refactoring] use _include_locator_regex instead of _locator_regex, and check in code for disallowed symbols. Same for _identifier_regex.
		// _include_locator_regex includes "$", which should not be in _locator_regex.
	- [P2,Dev] When creating x:type="view" and other views from HTML tags - check that there is no properties and styles,
		which are bound and have a static value at the same time
		// See x:type-"container": if (('static_styles' in container_config) && ('style_bindings' in container_config)) ...
Parsers/Directives.js
	- [P5,Feature] x:classBinding directive - alternative form for x:class attribute
	- [P5,Dev,Q] resources: need &lt;component path="..."&gt; tag inside &lt;resources&gt; to shorten paths
	- [P4,Dev] set_config_options template editing task:
		1) allow to set several options at once (via &lt;assigns&gt; collection) <br/>
		2) allow to use user-defined function as filter condition <br/>
		3) allow to select several items at once
	- [P3,Refactoring] known tasks for edit_template: move into separate object. Rename 'known' -> 'predefined'
	- [P2,Feature] Refactoring of &lt;x:refresher&gt; directive
		// 1) Allow attributes like 'class'.
		// 2) Allow packages for view refreshers (&lt;x:refresher type="$classname/RefresherName"&gt;)
	- [P3,Fix] x:attach_directives creates empty content template on wrapped tag. Must not create a template.
	- [P2,Refactoring] Lots of checks of data validity inside directives should be moved to processDirective().
		Get rid of is_top_directive switch (it equals to view_config_presence switch).
		// Also, try to gather data validity checks for resources in the resource tag handler
	- [P3,Fix,Q] Empty space between top directives should be removed
		// currently compile process does not remove it. See parse result on the reference page for x:option directive
	- [P4,Dev] For plural string definitions in resources: add check that number of strings matches number of plural forms in the locale
	- [P1,Refactoring] x:default_events directive should become an attribute on root x:widget tag
	- [P2,Refactoring,Q] allow "roles" attribute on widget definition directive (x:widget) - can be used instead of &lt;roles&gt; tag
	- [P1,Refactoring] universal x:config directive and &lt;config&gt; tag in widget definition,
		which integrates functionality of other directives
Parsers/ObjectParser.js
	- [P5,Feature,Q] allow Date and RegExp type in objects. Date will be created with "new" operator.
	- [P5,Feature] allow JavaScript comments
Parsers/TemplateParser.js
	- [P5,Feature,Q] allow to set class for widget extenders
	- [P4,Feature] implement removal of empty space from templates
	- [P5,Refactoring] remove unused lexer switches: preserve_whitespace ("pre:") and pure_blocks
	- [P5,Fix,Dev] _parseStyleAttribute: currently will not parse style strings which contain strings with semicolon inside them as style value
		// do not use such styles, use classes!
	- [P4,Fix] sequential strings are not always united into one
	- [P2,Fix] script[type="lava/fragment"] should work as s lexer switch - to allow it to break block boundaries
		// &lt;script type="lava/fragment"&gt;{#view()}&lt;/script&gt;{/view}.
		// Also correct the doc.html
Parsers/ExpressionParser.js
	- [P5,Feature,Q] macros to shorten the ternary operator, for example: "{is_active -&gt; 'active'}"
	- [P3,Feature, Performance] currently, each time any variable is referenced in argument's source code - it creates a new binding config.
		Parser must unite bindings to the same variable referenced multiple times.
	- [P3,Feature] static arguments must have their value in configs
	- [P5,Refactoring] remove the dn() operator. It's existence is not possible with current architecture.
		Finish the up() operator, or remove it also.
	- [P2,Refactoring] remove the `//depends:{}` operator (deprecated)
	- [P5,Performance] flags in result are rarely used, they should not be present by default (they take space in serialized templates).
		Either make separate method parseWithFlags() or make another parameter to existing method parse_with_flags.
System/App.class.js
	- [P3,Feature] app.createModule(config) - create a module with given schema
System/Enumerable.class.js
	- [P3,Feature] methods moveIndex(old_index, new_index) and moveValue(value, new_index)
		// is equivalent of removeAt, then insertAt for given value. Preserves UID.
	- [P3,Performance] Enumerable is inherited from Properties, but does not use _properties and _property_listeners.
		They should not take space in constructed objects.
	- [P5,Performance] It's possible to optimize updateFromEnumerable - do not calculate diff if there are no listeners.
		Also inspect other functions for optimization.
	- [P2,Feature] - select(), selectFirst() - like filter, but returns array, instead of modifying the instance
		// also, refactor the site:build/src/ContentLoader class for usage of new methods
System/PopoverManager.class.js
	- [P3,Fix] Tooltip blinks when moving cursor towards the tooltip
	- [P2,Feature] add an option to show empty tooltips
System/Sugar.class.js
	- [P5,Dev] always check that there are no redundant attributes on sugar tags
		// it's checked on root tag, but not on objects
	- [P5,Feature] allow to set the default widget config in sugar. It will allow to create a sugar with default options.
		// Reason: sometimes you will want to add options and other settings to sugar.
		// Such config must be merged properly.
	- [P5,Refactoring,Q] control attributes of sugar should be handled in Sugar class
	- [P3,Feature] when parsing sugar inside x:define and x:widget: sugar config must be merged with parent,
		and class name of sugar must be taken from config.
	- [P5,Feature,Q] Allow to create "alias" properties in storage objects. Reason: this will allow to create better-looking attribute names for sugar.
		For example: main attribute is called "is_active" (Boolean), alias will be called "active" (switch).
		// solution: descriptor for alias property has flag "isAlias", for example: {active: {type: "Switch", isAlias: true}, ...}.
		// Before &lt;storage&gt; tag and sugar parses the raw AST - they first collect a list of attributes,
		// which have an alias, to restrict them. When TemplateWalker walks a template - it ignores properties with isAlias flag.
	- [P4,Feature] sugar: allow content type that can map certain tags to items in storage collections.
		Aim: you will not need to write &lt;panels&gt; in &lt;accordion&gt;, just &lt;panel&gt;
System/Template.class.js
	- [P5,Performance,Q] render() function compilation.
		// Take into account that code may be compressed
	- [P5,Feature] static IF/ELSEIF/ELSE construct.
		// will include parts of template by evaluating it's conditions once.
		// Faster than regular IF view, but does not react to changes.
System/ViewManager.class.js
	- [P5,Performance,Q] speed up event dispatching and argument evaluation. Cache target and scope.
		+ Late evaluation for event arguments, as event does not always has valid targets.
	- [P5,Feature] leftclick and rightclick events.
		// algorithm: separate method for handling the click event, which checks "leftclick" and "rightclick" attributes,
		// and presence of right mouse button. Apply leftclick event on the doc.html page (for click to show method's extended description).
	- [P5,Feature,Q] give it ability to cancel event bubbling by elements
		// now only bubbling by widget hierarchy can be cancelled, not by elements
View/
	- [P5,Feature] View/Include.class.js - view, which takes it's template config from a variable (dynamic include)
	- [P5,Feature,Performance] View/Switch.class.js - analog of the IF view, but with one argument.
		// will also affect TemplateParser and configs
	- [P5,Refactoring] replace tagName in container.Morph with nodeName
		// must do it with tests, otherwise too dangerous
View/Foreach.class.js
	- [P3,Dev] "count" property must be read-only
	- [P5,Performance,Feature,Q] allow to reuse templates in Foreach
		// template may contain parameterized includes - such templates cannot be reused
	- [P5,Performance,Feature,Q] switch to cache and reuse templates by item UID. May be useful, when Foreach renders
		a small constant set of items, which can be filtered in view layer
		// like navigation tree on documentation page.
View/Container/Element.class.js
	- [P1,Fix,Dev] if you render it's content and change any attribute before it's in DOM,
		then you will get wrong content in DOM. Make protection from such lifecycle.
		// make "is_rendered"/"waits_insertion" switch and throw an error, if setting a property while it's on
View/Refresher/Standard.class.js
	- [P2,Refactoring] Move all animation code to refresher.Animated
Widget/Standard.class.js
	- [P5,Feature,Q] "cancel_bubble" event and role handler to allow declaratively cancel bubbling of roles and events from templates
		// three lines of code, but is it really needed?
	- [P2,Refactoring] move translateBoolean modifier from global space to widget instance method
		// widgets can be extended to allow dynamic locale switching. Booleans should be translatable with widget locale.
ClassManager.class.js
	- [P1,Feature] Add ability to store arrays in Shared (it may be named differently, like "Prototype")
		Move default input roles from InputAbstract to prototype
	- [P5,Feature,Q] Static members. Like Shared, but copied to prototype as-is. It's impossible to overwrite a Static member in inherited class.
	- [P5,Feature,Q] Function inheritance: check if function calls it's parent. If not - do not create a parent in the prototype.
	- [P3,Feature] mode, when classes are not exported. All classes exist only inside ClassManager, you can use .getConstructor() and .define()
	- [P5,Feature,Q] conditional members. Member will be in class when condition is true.
		// sometimes you want to create a build with different features included. Also some classes have debug members.
	- [P5,Feature] overrides: functions which does not need a parent
	- [P5,Feature] "final" functions and members - must not be overridden. Example: HierarchyMember._onRefreshed
	- [P5,Feature] abstract classes - classes with no constructor (instead there will be a function which throws an exception)
	- [P5,Feature] abstract functions - must be overridden in inherited classes.
		// Class with an abstract function which is not overridden - is also abstract.
		// When overriding happens - the parent function is not created
	- [P5,Feature,Q] empty class functions should not be in r[], they should be a reference somewhere to Lava.empty()/noop()
	- [P5,Feature,Q] all parent function names should be resolved automatically.
		// It will allow to insert a class in middle of the hierarchy.
		// Also assert there are no limitations for compression. <br/>
		// also rename &lt;%fname%&gt; macros in strings inside the function to current function's name (needed in exceptions).
	- [P5,Feature,Dev] wrapper for ClassManager to be used separately from the framework
	- [P5,Performance] Should it reserve nulls in object prototypes for those members, which are created in constructor?
		// Does it affect performance? Needs a test.
	- [P2,Feature] Static constructors. Move patches from container.Element and text inputs into static constructors
Serializer.js
	- [P5,Feature,Q] currently, serializing a string preserves the "\r\n" sequence.
		Convert it to "\n" by default and make a schema switch to return the old behaviour.
	- [P2,Feature] Add options
		// 1) Add an option to serialize into valid JSON format (with quoted attributes)
		// 2) Way to remove padding and spaces
transitions.js
	- [P2,Fix] more transitions (*)
Cron.js
	- [P5,Performance] use requestAnimationFrame
Lava.js
	- [P5,Refactoring] namespaces reservation: move to a separate file (this will allow to generate it in user projects)
	- [P5,Feature] create a script, which generates the file with namespaces in Lava.
	- [P3,Feature] Lava.addType() - add a new type to Lava.types
Algorithms/Sorting/
	- [P5,Feature,Performance] Need fast unstable sort algorithm (*)

#Existing widgets
Panels
	- [P2,Feature] when panels are collapsed, but their body stays in DOM - they should sleep() their content
Accordion
	- [P5,Feature] collapseAll()
Tree
	- [P3,Feature] must not contain Morph containers inside it
Select
	- [P3,Feature] there must be a sugar which parses it's content (optgroup and option tags)
		// it will be custom function, which is independent from Sugar class.
		// Schema will define where to put the result. <br/>
		// Requires Sugar modification.
	- [P5,Refactoring] browser fixes and code that accesses elements should be in Firestorm
DropDown
	- [P3,Feature] does not support the "disabled" class (is it needed?); "open" class should be assignable via option.
Calendar
	- [P5,Feature] should be constant size, support range selection and support full localization for "now" and month name
		// in some languages month and year numbers are not arabic
Inputs
	- [P5,Feature] working form_id attribute
	- [P3,Feature] validation for email input.
		// most likely, there will be separate class input.Email: it will have internal value and update it's is_valid property
		// just like input.Number. Text input with type="email" will not have validation (it's still a text input).
	- [P3,Feature] input watermarks
		// in Lava they will be elements before the input, with negative margin. It's the most reliable way.
	- [P4,Feature] input labels should be configured as attributes + standalone widget
	- [P5,Feature] moveCursorToStart(), moveCursorToEnd(), isCursorAtStart(), isCursorAtEnd() API for text inputs

#Create widgets
	- [P2,Feature] reorderable list (with mouse support)
	- [P2,Feature] list with selectable items (multiple selection, adding/removing items with Ctrl)
	- [P3,Feature] TimePicker
	- [P3,Feature] Slider
		// with hidden input field, left and right slider
	- [P3,Feature] Menu
		// with keyboard navigation
	- [P3,Feature] Validator - a separate widget with visitor pattern for validation rules
		// wraps the input
	- [P3,Feature] ProgressBar
	- [P3,Feature] Dialog
	- [P3,Feature] Pagination
	- [P3,Feature] ColorPicker
	- [P3,Feature] Rating
	- [P3,Feature] Alert widget (floating messages with color background and dismiss button)
	- [P5,Feature] Carousel
	- [P5,Feature] DataView
	- [P5,Feature] Affix/Scrollspy
	- [P5,Feature] Lightbox
	- [P5,Feature] Autocomplete (suggest) input
	- [P5,Feature] Calendar with event scheduler

#New functionality
	- [P2,Feature] finish FocusManager - a class which routes keyboard input to it's current "focused" target
		(target is a widget, which supports the 'focusable' interface)
	- [P3,Feature] Lava.system.CollectionListener - batch add listeners to items in Enumerable collections
	- [P5,Feature] Unit tests for all classes
	- [P5,Feature] Advanced code compression
	- [P5,Feature] Drag-and-Drop functionality
	- [P5,Feature] UI layer
	- [P5,Feature] Delay loading of images and objects
	- [P5,Feature] ARIA compatibility for widgets
	- [P5,Feature] Server-side communication for Data layer

#Build
	- [P3,Refactoring] a better build script
	- [P5,Feature,Q] build script should remove unnecessary members that depend on switches
		// Example: Lava.exportTranslatableString should be removed, when Lava.schema.parsers.EXPORT_STRINGS is off
	- [P5,Feature] the Lava Node module must not be exported to global
	- [P5,Feature] build script should write version and commit hash to the result files
	- [P5,Feature] Some classes include static parse results. For example: Tree class uses ExpressionParser.parseScopeEval() in class body.
		Such expressions should be evaluated on server.

#Site
	- [P5,Feature] this list should be turned into something more usable.
		// People should be able to leave comments, vote for features they need, and gather requirements.
		// This may be done in external service.
	- [P2,Feature] Widgets page must display source code of widget usage + it must be assembled like Examples
	- [P3,Refactoring] there must be no calls to TemplateParser (via Lava.bootstrap) in the www directory.
		Everything must be assembled on server.
	- [P3,Feature] Widgets page: each widget must have a detailed description with usage, events, roles, properties and options
	- [P3,Feature] a demo of a native widget wrapper (for example, CodeMirror, color pickers or Select2)
	- [P5,Feature] there must be an ability to launch unit tests right on the framework site
	- [P5,Feature] code coverage for unit tests, that can be viewed online
	- [P2,Refactoring] code in examples on main page is a bit messy, build process is complicated. Correct it.
	- [P2,Feature] Replace images in the tree, gif -&gt; png
		// other images should also be png
	- [P5,Feature] Create favicon
	- [P5,Feature] Better design than plain Bootstrap theme
	- [P2,Feature] create an example "Miner" game (in the Examples page)
	- [P5,Refactoring] when framework version reaches 1.0 - create "lava-1.0.js" in site `lib/` directory and replace
		the reference to the library in all JSFiddle examples. Documentation should also be versioned at this point.

#Documentation
	- [P4,Feature] Display @throws for methods
	- [P4,Feature] Box with source code should have language indication (js, xml, ...)
	- [P3,Feature] Document global events (those, fired from App)
		// events may be marked with "@lava-global-event" tag
	- [P3,Fix] Collapsible widget: unable to describe it's option, as it does not have a constructor.
	- [P3,Feature] Paragraphs in Reference must also have links, which can be referenced by @link tag
	- [P5,Refactoring] Refactor DocPage.class.js, move operations with hash into ContentLoader.class.js
	- [P5,Refactoring] Refactor buildDoc.js task. Now it's too complex.
	- [P2,Feature] Display values for most class properties either in their "value" column, or in their extended description.
		// Regular expressions, short arrays, callback maps. Example: Lava.ObjectParser.yy.allowed_globals.
		// This means that some properties will have extended description, like methods.
	- [P3,Feature] On Widgets page: show widget sources in collapsible panels
	- [P5,Feature] Check: if function returns a value - than it must be described in @returns JSDoc comment
		// this can be done with Esprima
	- [P5,Feature] If parent method has @returns and inherited has JSDoc block - than JSDoc block of inherited method
		must also contain @returns
	- [P2,Feature] Show source code for classes and make ability to reference lines of code.
		Link all members to their source.
	- [P2,Feature] Ability to filter classes and class members
	- [P2,Feature] Ability to create links to class members from user interface
		// hovering a member must show a link to it
	- [P5,Feature] Versioning of the documentation
	- [P2,Feature] Display "defined" and "overridden" fields for each member.
	- [P2,Feature] Tables with members must be collapsible. Tables with mixins must be collapsed by default.
	- [P1,Feature] Links to members must have "short" "middle" and "long" titles. Versions can be chosen by @sl (short link) and @fl (full link) tags.
		// Example: "Lava.mixin.Properties#on" - long, "Properties#on" - middle, "on" - short.
		// Also correct all links which already have a custom title.
	- [P2,Refactoring] Rewrite doc.html - must use IF view instead of manual widget insertion (depends on "Include" view).
	- [P5,Feature] make it look better with "warning" and "info" boxes, and other formatting tools
	- [P3,Feature] register links to examples in /www/examples.html so they could be referenced in documentation
	- [P4,Feature] make an instruction to automatically embed pieces of serialized code from the framework (methods, variables, etc).
		// Example: embed source of Lava.parseOptions in api_docs/ObjectParser
	- [P1,Fix] does not recognize @define tag (for example, on Lava.schema.DEBUG)
	- [P5,Feature] write extended description for class methods and properties
	- [P5,Feature] Describe the `count` property in Enumerable

#Maintenance
	- [P5,Feature] Automatic on-commit codestyle validation
		// one "var" per function, no camelCase, etc...

#Testing
	- [P1,Test] Check how framework handles focus management on Safari IOS (it does not support focus on links)
	- [P5,Test] Check if "click" events are delegated on IOS
	- [P5,Test] (old IE) IE8: check if get/set value on &lt;select&gt; elements works as expected. Write tests.

	- [P5,Test] fixes for old IE: check if event delegation for "change" event and others works in IE 8 and less.
	- [P2,Test] does textarea work correctly in IE8-9 (does it send "changed" on backspace, delete and cursor operations)?
	- [P5,Test] (old IE) seems, like in IE8 keyup/down/press events should be hanged on document instead of window?
