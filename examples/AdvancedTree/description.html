<p>Full-functional tree usage example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>data is loaded from a Module as Records</li>
	<li>both trees are bound to the same data</li>
	<li>internally widget uses MetaStorage class - this allows trees to expand nodes independently from each other.
		This also means, that nodes lose their expanded state, when the tree is destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Note: the right tree has animation disabled via template redefinition.
	There is another way to disable animation dynamically - via refresher API (see CollapsiblePanelExt widget for an example)
</p>
<p>See the widgets/Tree.class.js for the class source and standard widget templates for the template.</p>
