<p>This is the simplest HTML tree, built with the Framework.</p>
<p>The nodes, which have children, are highlighted in yellow by the widget's template.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The tree takes data from the ExamplesPage widget (see ExamplesPage::init for details).
	The <i>is_expanded</i> property is stored in the data record, so if several trees are bound to the same data - they share the expanded nodes.</p>
