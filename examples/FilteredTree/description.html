<p>This example demonstrates view-layer filtering: tree nodes are inserted and removed separately from each other.</p>

<p>This example expects the tree to be static, and will not properly detect added or removed records
	unless you change the filter text. It also does not track record title changes.</p>

<p>If you want to overcome these limitations, then you could:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create a "refresh" button</li>
	<li>Or use more complicated algorithms</li>
</ul>

<p>Better algorithm would use a Module data source with listeners on "title" and "parent" fields.</p>
