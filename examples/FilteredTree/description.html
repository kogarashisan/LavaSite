<p>This example demonstrates view-layer filtering: tree nodes are inserted and removed separately from each other.</p>

<p>This example expects the tree to be static, and will not properly detect added or removed records
	unless you change the filter text. It also does not track record title changes.</p>

<p>If you want to overcome these limitations, then you could:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create a "refresh" button</li>
	<li>Or use more complicated algorithms</li>
</ul>

<p>Better algorithm would use a Module data source with listeners on "title" and "parent" fields.</p>

<p>Note: this example removes nodes from DOM, but the same visual result could be achieved by hiding
	them with display:none or creating a new tree each time when filter changes.
	But in first case the sorting operation will become heavier (cause all nodes, which are in DOM, need to be moved).
	And in second case all tree needs to be re-rendered each time the filter or sorting changes (animation is impossible),
	and it will not react to changes (added or removed nodes).</p>
