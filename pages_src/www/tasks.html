				<h1>Development tasks</h1>

				<p>This is author's detailed TODO list for the framework (for general directions see the <a href="roadmap.html">Roadmap</a>).
					This page makes my work really public, but to understand something here - you need to know the source really well. Please, note:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This page does not include every possible author's thought on the framework, just tasks with settled requirements.</li>
					<li>This is temporary page - in future it needs to be replaced by some task-tracking service or GitHub tracker.</li>
					<li>the tasks are listed by categories, not priority.
						Some of them are proposals, and either may never be implemented, or may be implemented in a very different way.</li>
				</ul>

				<p style="font-weight: bold;">
					There are many tasks here, it can make impression that framework is somehow incomplete.
					In fact it's not true: compare this list to GitHub issues page of other frameworks, with hundreds of open tickets,
					and feel the difference!
				</p>
				<p>Most of performance-related tasks have low priority, cause framework is already fast like hell.</p>

				<p>Tags description:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="tag-Feature">Feature</span> - something that you would pay for, if it was a commercial product</li>
					<li><span class="tag-Dev">Dev</span> - assistance in development</li>
					<li><span class="tag-Fix">Fix</span> - some essential functionality which needs to be implemented</li>
					<li><span class="tag-Q">Q</span> - questionable proposal, something that may be discarded</li>
					Self-explanatory:
					<li><span class="tag-Bug">Bug</span></li>
					<li><span class="tag-Performance">Performance</span></li>
					<li><span class="tag-Refactoring">Refactoring</span></li>
					<li><span class="tag-Test">Test</span></li>
