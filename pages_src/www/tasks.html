<h1>Development tasks</h1>

<p>This is author's detailed TODO list for the framework (for general directions see the <a href="roadmap.html">Roadmap</a>).
	This page makes my work really public, but to understand something here - you need to know the source really well. Please, note:</p>
<ul>
	<li>This page does not include every possible author's thought on the framework, just tasks with settled requirements.</li>
	<li>This is temporary page - in future it needs to be replaced by some task-tracking service or GitHub tracker.</li>
	<li>the tasks are listed by categories, not priority.
		Some of them are proposals, and either may never be implemented, or may be implemented in a very different way.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">
	There are many tasks here, it can make impression that framework is somehow incomplete.
	In fact it's not true: compare this list to GitHub issues page of other frameworks, with hundreds of open tickets,
	and feel the difference!
</p>
<p>Most of performance-related tasks have low priority, cause framework is already fast like hell.</p>

<p>Tags description:</p>

	<li><span class="tag-Dev">Dev</span> - assistance in development</li>
	<li><span class="tag-Fix">Fix</span> - some essential functionality which needs to be implemented</li>
