				<h1>Welcome to LiquidLava documentation</h1>

				<p>Documentation is divided into the following sections:</p>
				<ul class="doc-default-text-list">
					<li><span><img src="/www/design/tree/tutorial.gif" /></span><a href="#tab=tutorials">Tutorials</a> - helps you make your first steps with the framework</li>
					<li><span><img src="/www/design/tree/reference.gif" /></span><a href="#tab=reference">Reference</a> - detailed explanation of every aspect of the framework</li>
					<li><span><img src="/www/design/tree/class.gif" /></span><a href="#tab=api">API</a> - generated automatically from source code files</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Introducing LiquidLava</h2>

				<p>Lava is an MVC framework with unique architecture: everything here is a class,
					or at least a JavaScript object. Lava has excellent sources, so if something is unclear to you -
					then sources is the first place, where you should search for answers.</p>

				<h3>So, what is LiquidLava?</h3>
				<p style="padding-left: 2em">You may think of it as better alternative to modern frameworks with data-bound templates,
					like Angular and Ember. Everything you can do with these frameworks - you can do with Lava,
					except that Lava does it better. So, if you are tired of endless problems and bugs with other frameworks -
					consider trying Lava instead, you will feel a relief and boost to your productiveness.</p>

				<h3>Project status?</h3>
				<p style="padding-left: 2em">Lava is already mature enough to be comfortably used in small projects.
					Lack of unit tests is compensated by numerous debug checks, API is mostly stable.</p>

				<p style="padding-left: 2em">Currently it lacks some high-level features, like server-side communication or routing, and that's the reason,
					why it's still considered alpha. Some of missing features can be replaced by third-party scripts,
					but even now it's powerful enough to impress you.</p>

				<h2>Introducing Firestorm</h2>

				<p>Firestorm is a low-level DOM access library, currently built on top of MooTools.
					It does not extend prototypes of native JavaScript objects - this makes it extremely simple and reusable.
					In fact, it's a collection of JavaScript objects with public API.</p>
				<p>Any access to DOM tree must be done using Firestorm API (although, there are exceptions).</p>
