#Scope layer

The term "scope layer" refers to classes inside the src/Scope folder.
These classes are used each time the framework needs to evaluate an expression, 
so it's important to understand how they work. Most likely, you will never need to create any of them directly.

All scopes extend {@link Lava.mixin.Refreshable}, which allows them to form a hierarchy of dependent instances.
Hierarchy is needed to maintain correct refresh order.

##PropertyBinding

{@link Lava.scope.PropertyBinding} can be used to bind to instances of {@link Lava.mixin.Properties} mixin.
It's used to bind to views and widgets, since they all extend it.

You can execute the following example in your browser's console:

```javascript
var binding_target = new Lava.mixin.Properties({
	test: 'value1'
});
// second parameter is property name
var property_binding = new Lava.scope.PropertyBinding(binding_target, 'test');

property_binding.getValue(); // returns 'value1'

binding_target.set('test', 'new value');
property_binding.getValue(); // still returns 'value1'

Lava.ScopeManager.refresh();
property_binding.getValue(); // now returns 'new value'
```

As you see, scope did not refresh it's value immediately, only after calling {@link Lava.ScopeManager#refresh}.
Alternatively, you can make a click anywhere on page: every DOM event listener callback ends with a call to `refresh()`.

How it works:
- when you call `set` on `binding_target` - scope receives the "property changed" event from {@link Lava.mixin.Properties}
- scope places itself into refresh queue in {@link Lava.ScopeManager}
- on every refresh cycle {@link Lava.ScopeManager} calls {@link Lava.mixin.Refreshable#refresh} of every scope in it's queue.
During this process new scopes may be added into the queue. Process stops when there are no scopes to refresh.
- when PropertyBinding instance receives `refresh()` call - it compares the old and new property values of the bound object.
If values differ - it refreshes it's local value and fires it's own {@link Lava.scope.PropertyBinding#event:changed} event.

```javascript
var test_handler = {
	onChanged: function() {console.log('Inside the changed event handler');}
};
var listener = property_binding.on('changed', test_handler.onChanged, test_handler);

binding_target.set('test', 'This value differs from previous');
Lava.ScopeManager.refresh();
// you will see "Inside the changed event handler" in console

property_binding.removeListener(listener);
```

Also note, that bound property does not necessarily need to exist:
```javascript
var example_binding = new Lava.scope.PropertyBinding(new Lava.mixin.Properties(), 'test');
example_binding.getValue(); // returns undefined
```

###Setiing bound values

To provide two-way binding for input controls, PropertyBinding, {@link Lava.scope.DataBinding}
and {@link Lava.scope.Segment} support setting the bound value.

```javascript
property_binding.setValue('this value was set via setValue');
```

Note: call to `setValue` will update the bound source, but not the current scope value. 
You may need to call {@link Lava.ScopeManager#refresh} to receive "changed" event.

##DataBinding

{@link Lava.scope.DataBinding} is constructed from PropertyBinding and binds to property of it's value.
PropertyBinding itself may return anything: object, instance of Properties, Enumerable, string or even null.

```javascript

// ... previous example goes here ...

binding_target.set('test', {
	property_of_test: 'second level property'
});
Lava.ScopeManager.refresh();
var data_binding = new Lava.scope.DataBinding(property_binding, 'property_of_test');

// or:
// var data_binding = property_binding.getDataBinding('property_of_test');

data_binding.getValue(); // returns 'second level property'
```

Note, that if you bind to a plain object, like in previous example, DataBinding will not detect changes to it's properties.

```javascript
var data_source = binding_target.get('test');
data_source.property_of_test = 'new value'; // it's a plain object

Lava.ScopeManager.refresh();
data_binding.getValue(); // still returns 'second level property'

// now we assign completely new object
binding_target.set('test', {
	property_of_test: 'new value of object property'
});
Lava.ScopeManager.refresh();
data_binding.getValue(); // now returns 'new value of object property'
```

There are two ways to make DataBinding to detect changes: either to bind it to a Properties instance,
or change the whole object, to which it's bound - in that case it will receive 'changed' event from PropertyBinding
and update itself. Example of binding to an object:

```javascript
// now it will always detect changes
binding_target.set('test', new Lava.mixin.Properties({
	property_of_test: 'new value of object property'
}));

binding_target.get('test').set('property_of_test', 'this will be detected');
```

###Binding to Enumerable and array indices

You can bind to {@link Lava.system.Enumerable} indices, and be notified when bound index changes.

```javascript
var demo_enumerable = new Lava.system.Enumerable(['initial value']);
property_binding.setValue(demo_enumerable);
var index_data_binding = property_binding.getDataBinding('0');
demo_enumerable.replaceAt(0, 'new value at index 0');
// data_binding has received 'collection_changed' event from Enumerable and will update it's value
```

This way you can also retrieve indices of common arrays, but framework does not track changes in plain JavaScript objects.

##Scope chains in expressions

When you evaluate a property in expression - a {@link Lava.scope.PropertyBinding} is created:

```text
{#> count}
```

This will find a view with `count` property and call it's {@link Lava.view.Abstract#getDataBinding} 
(returns an instance of {@link Lava.scope.PropertyBinding}).

When you evaluate a chain of properties - additional {@link Lava.scope.DataBinding} instances are created:

```text
{#> my_object.property1.property2}
```

First, framework will retrieve an instance of PropertyBinding which is bound to `my_object` property. 
Then getDataBinding is called from that instance ({@link Lava.scope.PropertyBinding#getDataBinding}) - 
it returns {@link Lava.scope.DataBinding}. And in the same way - third segment will be created from the second one.

So, the above expression can be evaluated manually in the following way:

```javascript
// We want to evaluate this expression in context of `current_view`
var view_with_property = current_view.locateViewWithProperty("my_object");
var bind1 = view_with_property.getDataBinding("my_object"); // returns an instance of PropertyBinding
var bind2 = bind1.getDataBinding("property1"); // returns an instance of DataBinding
var bind3 = bind2.getDataBinding("property2"); // returns DataBinding
var chain_value = bind3.getValue();
```

##Segments

Segments bind to a dynamically selected property name.

```javascript
var data_source = new Lava.mixin.Properties({
	people: {
		good_man: 'Harry Potter',
		bad_man: 'Lord Voldemort'
	},
	name_source: 'good_man' // we will show `data_source.people.good_man`
});

// the scope, which will tell us, who we want to show
var name_source_binding = new Lava.scope.PropertyBinding(data_source, 'name_source');
// in practice, `data_source` will be an instance of a view or widget (they inherit from Properties)
var container = new Lava.scope.PropertyBinding(data_source, 'people');
var segment = new Lava.scope.Segment(container, name_source_binding);
segment.getValue(); // returns 'Harry Potter'

name_source_binding.setValue('bad_man'); // select different property in container
Lava.ScopeManager.refresh();
segment.getValue(); // now returns 'Lord Voldemort'
```

In the case above, segment is bound to another property inside `data_source` (`people`), 
but in practice you do not need a separate property. 
Here is an example when variable which holds the name and dynamically selected properties belong to the same object 
({@link Lava.widget.Standard} implements {@link Lava.mixin.Properties}):

```javascript
var test_widget = new Lava.widget.Standard({is_extended: true});
test_widget.setProperties({
	good_man: 'Harry Potter',
	bad_man: 'Lord Voldemort',
	name_source: 'good_man' // we will show `data_source.people.good_man`
});

var name_source_binding = test_widget.getDataBinding('name_source'); // returns instance of Lava.scope.PropertyBinding
var segment = test_widget.getSegment(name_source_binding); // returns instance of Lava.scope.Segment
segment.getValue(); // returns 'Harry Potter'

name_source_binding.setValue('bad_man');
Lava.ScopeManager.refresh();
segment.getValue(); // now returns 'Lord Voldemort'
```

Internally, Segment gets the property name, which it should bind to, from `name_source_binding` scope.
And then calls getDataBinding from it's value container (first argument, either scope or widget).

Note: from architect's point of view it's much better to put selected records into a separate property, like in the first example.
Especially, if you add records to `people` dynamically.

See also: {@link Lava.widget.Standard#getDataBinding}.

##Segments in expressions

Segments are created with square bracket syntax. Examples, described above, are equivalent to the following expressions:

```text
{#> people[name_source]}
```

```text
{#> $my_widget[name_source]}
```

First expression will find views which have `people` and `name_source` properties, and create PropertyBindings to them:

```javascript
// We are evaluating this expression in context of `current_view`
var data_source = current_view.locateViewWithProperty("people").getDataBinding('people'); // returns PropertyBinding
var name_source = current_view.locateViewWithProperty("name_source").getDataBinding('name_source'); // returns PropertyBinding
var segment = new Lava.scope.Segment(data_source, name_source);
```

Second will find the widget, named "my_widget", and use it as `data_source`.
See {@link reference:WritingExpressions} reference for better explanation.

Warning: you can not create segments from segments. Such syntax is not allowed:

```text
// invalid:
people[something[another_thing]]
people[get_name()]
```

Inside square brackets there must be no other square brackets or function calls.
Even if you create such construct by hands, it's not guaranteed, that it will be able update itself correctly.
However, any paths to variables are allowed in `name_source`:

```text
// valid:
something[other_thing.property1.property2].another_thing
something[$my_widget.another_thing]
something[$my_widget~1->another_thing]
$my_widget.do_something(people[name_source])
```

For explanation of constructs like `$my_widget~1->another_thing` - see {@link reference:WritingExpressions}.

##setValue on DataBinding and segment

They also support `setValue()`, but unlike PropertyBinding, which is always bound to a widget, 
Segment and DataBinding may be bound to different kinds of objects, which may be null sometimes. 
If setValue is impossible - it will be ignored silently.

##Scope caching

Once you bind to any property - a new scope is created. When you bind to the same property again, you will receive
the same scope instance. Segments are also cached.

```javascript
var test_widget = new Lava.widget.Standard({is_extended: true});
var binding1 = test_widget.getDataBinding('property1');
var binding2 = binding1.getDataBinding('property2');

binding1 == test_widget.getDataBinding('property1'); // true
binding2 == binding1.getDataBinding('property2'); // true

var segment = test_widget.getSegment(binding1);
segment == test_widget.getSegment(binding1); // true
```
