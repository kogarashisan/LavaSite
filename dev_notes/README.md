This folder is not published on site. It contains architecture notes for LiquidLava contributors and core developers.
Most people will never need to read these documents.
This is NOT tutorials or reference, most of data in this folder requires very good understanding of the framework.

Every complex and unclear question about internal design of the framework will be eventually answered here, like:
	- "Why there is a call to Lava.ScopeManager#refresh in widget.Standard#inject?"
	- "Why there is no #remove() on listeners?"
	- "Why you can not search templates from parents to children (only from children to parents)?"

Also, here you may find open architectural problems.
