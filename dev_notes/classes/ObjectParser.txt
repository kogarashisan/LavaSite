Technically, it's possible to implement white list of methods, that can be called, like:
<options>
	{
		something: Lava.TemplateParser.parse('...')
	}
</options>
But there is no need for it - standard directives provide everything you need.

The above example is malicious: templates must not be stored in options
(there is a special place for them - "includes"). If you store templates in options
- then configs will not be traversable.
