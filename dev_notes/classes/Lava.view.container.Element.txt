You can not bind style and class properties directly, as a value, for example:
<div x:bind:style="item.is_active ? 'color: red; font-weight: bold' : 'opacity: 0.5'">
For classes this has no sense, since such binding is a subcase of normal class binding.
For styles: seems like it would be convenient to return several styles with one expression (like shown above),
but the same effect can be achieved by applying different CSS classes, and it's a good practice.
