There was a try to make some kind of a "write lock", and some kind of public-read/private-write Enumerable
(instance of Enumerable which could be writable by only one instance of another class, 
and readable by anyone else).

Reason: sometimes there are collections, which you should not modify from outside, 
for example collections of widgets in another widget (Tabs, Accordion).

Result: failed, and made a conclusion that having something like this is wrong by design.
The right way is "private widget properties" (name starts with underscore).
If such write lock existed - it could be implemented with Object.freeze on one of Enumerable arrays.
