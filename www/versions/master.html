<h3>Feature</h3>
<ul>
	<li>New way to create refreshers in Foreach and If views: createRefresher() instance method,
		that can be used during roles registration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Refactoring</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Removed x:broadcast directive and associated functionality - it's redundant (same can be done with roles).</li>
	<li>Serializer is now a separate class - Lava.system.Serializer. Default instance can be accessed as `lava.serializer`.</li>
	<li>Changed protected API in Foreach and If views.</li>
	<li>edit_template widget definition tag is now marked as ALPHA.</li>
	<li>Tree widget: animation is now disabled by default, but can be turned on via config option
		(you can assign refresher for nodes)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fix</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Now x:equiv attribute is correctly removed from parsed tag.</li>
</ul>
