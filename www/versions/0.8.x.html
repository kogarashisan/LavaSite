<p>No significant changes. Forgot to increment version in files.</p>

<h2>0.8.0</h2>

<div style="padding-left: 2em">

	<h3>Feature</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>New way to create refreshers in Foreach and If views: createRefresher() instance method,
			that can be used during roles registration.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Refactoring</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Removed x:broadcast directive and associated functionality - it's redundant (same can be done with roles).</li>
		<li>Serializer is now a separate class - Lava.system.Serializer. Default instance can be accessed as `lava.serializer`.</li>
		<li>Changed protected API in Foreach and If views.</li>
		<li>edit_template widget definition tag is now marked as ALPHA.</li>
		<li>Tree widget: animation is now disabled by default, but can be turned on via config option
			(you can assign refresher for nodes)</li>
		<li>Generated ClassManager classes are now faster in Firefox</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Fix</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Now x:equiv attribute is correctly removed from parsed tag.</li>
	</ul>
