All DOM manipulation should be done with Firestorm. If functionality is present in Firestorm - 
you should use it, rather then calling iQuery directly.

For example, if property of a DOM element has accessor in Firestorm, like `Firestorm.Element.getOuterHTML()` - 
then you should use that method. If property has `attributeNode` - then use `Firestorm.Element.getProperty()` - 
most properties are accessible with this method.

However, there are element fields, that should be accessed directly. They include:
- `focus()` and `blur()` methods (although, using `blur()` is not recommended by W3C)
- core DOM properties that work in all browsers, like `offsetHeight`, `parentNode` and `firstChild`

Be aware, that over time framework will become independent from jQuery, and you will not need to include it anymore.

Some browsers do not iterate over overwritten Object's prototype properties. Example from MooTools library:

```javascript
var enumerables = true;
for (var i in {toString: 1}) enumerables = null;
```

In most browsers `enumerables` will be null (browser iterates over 'toString'), but it's not safe to rely on this behaviour.
Firestorm does not provide a fix for this issue in any form, so either:
- do not override Object's prototype properties - from architect's point of view it's the best solution
- or implement the fix yourself. See overloadSetter function from MooTools as example
